    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the fish, curry paste, egg yolk and sugar in a food processor. Process until fine, scraping the sides as needed. Then keep processing for a few minutes longer until the fish is firm enough that it holds its shape well when spooned (see video). If this is your first time, cook up a bit of the mixture to taste for salt and spiciness. If you want a stronger curry flavour or more spiciness, add more curry paste, keeping in mind that that also adds more saltiness. If you just want more saltiness, add a little fish sauce. </li>
        <Li>Transfer the fish paste into a mixing bowl and add chopped long beans, Thai basil and kaffir lime leaves; stir until well combined.</Li>
        <Li>Get your station ready by having a bowl of cold water and some paper towel (for your hands) by the stove.  Heat a skillet over medium heat until hot, then add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. Wet your hands and a tablespoon in the cold water, then scoop a heaping tablespoon of fish paste with the wet spoon and place in your hands. Gently pat the fish cakes to form into patties and place in a preheated skillet. Fry until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. You may need to add more oil as you go. </Li>
    </ol>
